CA_Shuttle C

- An unmanned option to utilize the ET and booster stack of the Space Shuttle program. The C has no heat tiles or aerodynamic considerations as it isn't intended to return safely. Its lighter weight and disposable nature make it perfect for unusually heavy payloads and high altitude and satellite deployment missions. This 2 engine version is capable of delivering 20-30 tons into high Kerbin orbit.
